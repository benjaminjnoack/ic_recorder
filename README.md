# IC RECORDER

This is an application to backup MP3 files from a Sony IC RECORDER (Model: ICD-UX560) to local disk.

#### TODO

Make the application portable by dynamically discovering the username.
* the path unit should glob
* the service file could call the main program with an argument
* or the main program could query the operating system for that information

Use the notification system in Linux to display how many files have been moved
